# bc-ProjectRepo-PropertyRegistration
Problem Statement : As part of this project, we wrote the smart contracts for the property registration system then deployed the chaincode on top of the property registration network, the code files for which were provided  as part of the project.

 Now, as part of this practice problem, we need to build two CLI-based node applications, one for the users to interact with the functions that are defined in the smart contract for the users and the other for the registrar to interact with the functions that are defined in the smart contract for the registrar. After building the node applications, you will expose these node modules as APIs and access these using HTTP requests. Note that this is covered in the optional session of the module ‘Application Development on Hyperledger Fabric’. After exposing each node module for different transactions, instead of using a frontend GUI, you will use the Postman app to send HTTP requests. You will learn how to use the Postman app to send HTTP requests in the upcoming segments.
